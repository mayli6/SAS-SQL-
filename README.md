# Diabetes Data Exploration & Cleaning Using SAS SQL

In this study, a dataset that contains diabetes related information is chosen to be explored and processed using a well-known data management tool named SAS. The diabetes dataset was collected by Tigga and Garg (2020) through surveys of 952 participants with age of 18 and above. The dataset is retrieved from an open-source website named Kaggle. In Part 1, initial exploration will be performed to understand the data structure and identify variables with inconsistent or missing values through proper visualizations. Appropriate pre-processing techniques will be adopted to handle the incomplete and inconsistent data with detailed explanations. <br />

Using the partially pre-processed dataset in Part 1, several procedures are carried out to perform feature engineering in Part 2, particularly in the conversion of categorical to numerical variables.
